    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>To ensure macarons are the same size, you can trace 1-inch circles with a pencil on parchment paper, then flip the paper and use the circles as a guide when piping.</p>

    <p>If you want to dye the macaron batter, add food coloring to egg whites in step 2; make the mixture a few shades darker than desired as baking will lighten the color. 
        Use colors in powders or gel form - liquid food coloring may add too much moisture to the egg mixture and change the consistency.</p>
