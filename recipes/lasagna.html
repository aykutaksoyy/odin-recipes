    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. 
        After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that varies based on different local traditions. </p>

    <p>There is a fresh version of lasagna that requires pre-boiling the pasta before filling it or adding sauce and then baking.
        There are also commercial versions, however, that allow for spreading the pasta in a baking pan and filling it or adding more liquid sauces so that the pasta softens during cooking.</p>
